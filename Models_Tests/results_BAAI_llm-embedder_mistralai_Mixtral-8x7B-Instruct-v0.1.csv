Project Scheduling.pdf,What is the given file about?,8.998328,3.440652,"
The given file is about software project management, specifically project scheduling. It provides notes and principles for scheduling a software project, including the problem table, network of activities, and critical path concepts. The file also includes a table for tracking tasks, their duration, dependencies, and precedence relations, as well as a network of activities and critical path calculations."
Project Scheduling.pdf,Explain about the Principles of Scheduling,8.998328,8.399556,"
The Principles of Scheduling are a set of guidelines that should be followed to ensure effective and efficient project scheduling. These principles include:
1. Compartmentalization: The project must be broken down into smaller, manageable activities or tasks.
2. Interdependency: The relationship between these tasks must be determined to understand the sequence in which they need to be completed.
3. Time allocation: Each task should be allocated a specific duration in terms of work units, such as person-days of effort.
4. Effort validation: The number of people assigned to a task should not exceed the allocated number of work units.
5. Defined responsibilities: Each task should be assigned to a specific team member.
6. Defined outcomes: Each task should have a clear and specific outcome.
7. Defined milestones: Each task or group of tasks should be associated with a project milestone, which is achieved when the work product has been reviewed and approved for quality.
These principles help ensure that the project schedule is well-defined, manageable, and efficient, and that the project team is aware of their responsibilities and the expected outcomes."
Project Scheduling.pdf,What is critical path?,8.998328,1.597464,"
Critical path is the longest duration in the project schedule. Delay in critical path will delay the project schedule. Path with zero slack is called critical path."

Contention-based protocols with scheduling mechanism do not have specific examples or instances of the protocols that manage network traffic by prioritizing packets based on their urgency or importance, as per the context information, the protocols that manage network traffic by prioritizing packets based on their urgency or importance. This is because the network was congested, and there was a need to ensure that the critical data or information reaches the destination in time. 

Explanation:
Contention-based protocols with scheduling mechanism are protocols that manage network traffic by prioritizing packets based on their urgency or importance. This is because the network was congested, and there was a need to ensure that the critical data or information reaches the destination in time. The context information suggests that the protocols were used when the network was congested, and there was a need to prioritize packets based on their urgency or importance.

The table shows the maintenance of routes from Node 15 to 11, Node 170 to 180, and Node IY to 256."
Screenshot 2024-09-10 223242.png,Explain the routing table given in the picture,4.34148,0.282294,"

The routing table provided in the picture is for the DSDV (Destination-Sequenced Distance Vector) routing protocol. The table contains information about the destination nodes, their next hop, distance, and sequence number.

The columns in the table have the following meanings:

* DestinationID: The ID of the destination node.
* Det: The destination sequence number, which is used to prevent routing loops and ensure that the latest information is used.
* NexNode: The next hop node to reach the destination.
* Dist: The distance to reach the destination node.
* SccNo: The sequence number of the last update received for this destination.

For example, the first row in the table indicates that to reach the node with ID ""Nade"", the next hop is node 15, and the distance is 11 hops. The sequence number of the last update received for this destination is 162.

Similarly, the second row shows that to reach the node with ID ""170"", the next hop is node 186, and the distance is 180 hops. The sequence number of the last update received for"
Screenshot 2024-09-10 223242.png,Route between which nodes is broken in the given picture?,4.34148,0.286494,"
Based on the table provided, it appears that the route between the nodes ""Nade"" and ""Movement"" is experiencing issues, as indicated by the ""Det"" column value of ""Movement"" for the ""Nade"" destination. This suggests that there is a problem with the movement of packets or data along this route. However, without additional context or information, it is difficult to determine the exact nature or cause of the problem."
