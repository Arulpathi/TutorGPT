Project Scheduling.pdf,What is the given file about?,11.360843,3.083331,"
The given file is a document about software project management, specifically focusing on project scheduling. It explains the principles of scheduling, such as compartmentalization, interdependency, time allocation, effort validation, defined responsibilities, defined outcomes, and defined milestones. The document also introduces a problem table and network of activities, and explains the concept of the critical path and slack/float."
Project Scheduling.pdf,Explain about the Principles of Scheduling,11.360843,8.4535,"
The Principles of Scheduling are a set of guidelines that help in effectively managing and organizing tasks in a project. These principles include:
1. Compartmentalization: The project is divided into smaller, manageable activities and tasks.
2. Interdependency: The interdependency of each task is determined, i.e., which tasks depend on the completion of other tasks.
3. Time allocation: Each task is allocated a certain number of work units, such as person-days of effort.
4. Effort validation: The project manager must ensure that no more than the allocated number of people have been scheduled at any given time.
5. Defined responsibilities: Every task that is scheduled should be assigned to a specific team member.
6. Defined outcomes: Every task that is scheduled should have a defined outcome.
7. Defined milestones: Every task or group of tasks should be associated with a project milestone. A milestone is accomplished when one or more work products has been reviewed for quality and has been approved."
Project Scheduling.pdf,What is critical path?,11.360843,2.28098,"

The critical path is the longest duration in a project schedule. A delay in the critical path will result in a delay in the project schedule. The critical path is identified by finding the path with zero slack, where slack is the difference between late finish and early finish of an activity."

Hall: HALL 1
Date: 26.03.2024
Time: 5.30-7.10pm

Explanation:

* From the context information, we can see that the table shows the schedule for various subjects in different halls and times.
* The subject 19Z604 is not explicitly mentioned in the table, but we can infer that it is related to the subject 192604, which appears in the same row as the time slot 5.30-7.10pm in HALL 1.
* The subject 192604 is associated with the course BE CSE G2, as shown in the first row of the table.

Based on the provided context information, there is no direct example of Contention-based protocols with scheduling mechanism. However, the table seems to show some network-related information, including nodes (Elu, Voa, Inaruh), their identifiers (#ini, 623), and some other parameters. Contention-based protocols are a type of medium access control (MAC) protocol where nodes compete for access to the shared medium, and scheduling mechanisms help manage this competition. Without further context or information, it is not possible to provide a specific example of Contention-based protocols with scheduling mechanism from the given data."

The given file is a screenshot of a table showing route maintenance in DSDV (Destination-Sequenced Distance Vector). The table displays the Destination ID, Detection (Det), Next Node (NexNode), Distance (Dist), and Sequence Number (SccNo) for various destinations. The Detection indicates whether the destination is in movement or not, and the Sequence Number is used to prevent the old routing information from circulating in the network."
Screenshot 2024-09-10 223242.png,Explain the routing table given in the picture,8.776911,8.92509,"

The routing table provided in the picture is for the DSDV (Destination-Sequenced Distance Vector) routing protocol. The table contains information about the destination nodes, their next hop, distance, and sequence number.

The columns in the table have the following meanings:

* DestinationID: The ID of the destination node.
* Det: The destination sequence number, which is used to prevent routing loops and ensure that the latest information is used.
* NexNode: The next hop node to reach the destination.
* Dist: The distance to reach the destination node.
* SccNo: The sequence number of the last update received for this destination.

For example, the first row in the table indicates that to reach the node with ID ""Nade"", the next hop is node 15, and the distance is 11 hops. The sequence number of the last update received for this destination is 162.

Similarly, the second row shows that to reach the node with ID ""170"", the next hop is node 186, and the distance is 180 hops. The sequence number of the last update received for"

Based on the table provided, it appears that the route between the nodes ""Nade"" and ""Movement"" is experiencing issues, as indicated by the ""Det"" column value of ""Movement"" for the ""Nade"" destination. This suggests that there is a problem with the movement of packets or data along this route. However, without additional context or information, it is difficult to determine the exact nature or cause of the problem."
