Project Scheduling.pdf,Explain about the Principles of Scheduling,9.820929,5.594916,"
The principles of scheduling are the rules that are followed to ensure that a project is completed on time and within budget. The principles include compartmentalization, interdependency, time allocation, effort validation, defined responsibilities, defined outcomes, defined milestones, and critical path. These principles ensure that the project is broken down into manageable activities and tasks, the interdependency of each activity or task is determined, each task is allocated some number of work units, the project manager ensures that no more than the allocated number of workers are scheduled at any given time, tasks are assigned to specific team members, and tasks have defined outcomes and milestones. The principles also ensure that the critical path is determined, and the project is completed on time and within budget."

Screenshot 2024-09-10 223012.png,What are the types of MAC protocols for Ad-hoc wireless networks?,4.216771,4.732715,"

MAC protocols for Ad-hoc wireless networks can be broadly classified into two categories: 

1. Contention-based protocols: These protocols allow nodes to compete for the channel access. Examples include ALOHA, CSMA/CA, and 802.11 DCF.

2. Controlled-access protocols: These protocols control the channel access by implementing a scheduling algorithm. Examples include the 802.11 PCF and 802.11 HCF.

Note: The above answer is based on the context information and not prior knowledge."
Screenshot 2024-09-10 223012.png,Given examples for Contention-based protocols with scheduling mechanism,4.216771,5.034299,"

Contention-based protocols are protocols in which multiple devices share a medium by contending for access to the medium. In such protocols, each device has an equal chance to access the medium. However, in scenarios where the number of devices is large, contention leads to collisions and waste of resources. To overcome this, scheduling mechanisms are introduced in contention-based protocols. Scheduling mechanisms provide a structured way of accessing the medium, where each device is given a specific time slot to access the medium. This way, the contention-based protocols with scheduling mechanisms provide a more structured and efficient way of accessing the medium in scenarios with a large number of devices."
