"
Project Scheduling.pdf,Explain about the Principles of Scheduling,10.770929,6.115883," According to the provided context, the Principles of Scheduling are as follows:

1. **Compartmentalization**: The project must be broken down into manageable activities and tasks. This helps in understanding the interdependencies between tasks.

2. **Interdependency**: The interdependency of each compartmentalized activity or task must be determined. This helps in identifying the tasks that are dependent on each other.

3. **Time allocation**: Each task to be scheduled must be allocated some number of work units (e.g., person-days of effort). This helps in estimating the time required to complete each task.

4. **Effort validation**: The project manager must ensure that no more than the allocated number of people have been scheduled at any given time. This helps in avoiding overloading of tasks and ensuring that each task is completed within the allocated time.

5. **Defined responsibilities**: Every task that is scheduled should be assigned to a specific team member. This helps in ensuring that each task is completed by the responsible person.

6. **Defined outcomes**: Every task that is scheduled should have a defined outcome. This helps in ensuring that each task is completed with a specific goal in mind.

7. **Defined milestones**: Every task or group of tasks should be associated with a project milestone. A"
Project Scheduling.pdf,What is critical path?,10.770929,2.126126," Critical path gives you the longest duration. Delay in critical path will delay the project schedule. Path with zero slack is called critical path.  In other words, the critical path is the sequence of tasks that determines the minimum duration required to complete the project. It is the path with the least slack or float, which means that any delay in any task on this path will delay the project completion."

Screenshot 2024-09-10 223242.png,Explain the routing table given in the picture,4.408901,5.750779," The routing table given in the picture is a snapshot of the routing information in the DSDV (Dynamic Source Routing) protocol. The table shows the routing information for three destinations: Nade, 170, and IY.

The columns in the table represent the following information:

* DestinationID: The ID of the destination node.
* Det: The type of movement of the destination node (e.g., ""Movement"" for a node that is moving).
* NexNode: The next node on the path to the destination node.
* Dist: The distance to the destination node.
* SccNo: The sequence number of the routing information (used for detecting and correcting routing errors).

The routing table shows that:

* To reach Nade, the next node is 15, which is 11 hops away.
* To reach 170, the next node is 186, which is 142 hops away.
* To reach IY, the next node is 214, which is 256 hops away.

The routing table is used by the DSDV protocol to determine the best path to a destination node. The protocol uses a combination of distance and sequence numbers to determine the best path. The distance is used to determine the shortest path to the destination, while the"

The picture shows that the node 170 has a distance of 142 to node 186, but the shortest path distance is 180. This indicates that the route between these nodes is broken.  The other routes in the picture seem to be functioning properly.  The picture is a screenshot of a DSDV (Dynamic Source Routing) protocol, which is used in mobile ad-hoc networks. The picture shows the route maintenance process in DSDV, where the nodes are represented by their IDs, and the distances between them are represented by the numbers in the table. The picture is used to illustrate the concept of route maintenance in DSDV, where the nodes in the network are dynamically updated to ensure that the routes between them are always the shortest possible.  The picture is a useful tool for understanding the concept of route maintenance in DSDV, and it can be used to help students learn about the protocol.  The picture is also a useful tool for understanding the concept of route maintenance in general, and it can be used to help students learn about the importance of maintaining routes in a network.
