It is a must-have resource for anyone involved in software project management.  It is a valuable resource that provides a detailed understanding of the principles and concepts of project scheduling and critical path analysis. "
Project Scheduling.pdf,Explain about the Principles of Scheduling,5.164009,5.663818," The Principles of Scheduling are a set of guidelines that help in managing a software project effectively. These principles are:

1. **Compartmentalization**: The project must be broken down into smaller, manageable activities and tasks. This helps in focusing on one task at a time and ensures that each task is completed before moving on to the next one.

2. **Interdependency**: The interdependency of each compartmentalized activity or task must be determined. This helps in identifying the tasks that are dependent on each other and ensures that they are completed in the correct order.

3. **Time allocation**: Each task to be scheduled must be allocated some number of work units (e.g., person-days of effort). This helps in ensuring that each task is completed within the allocated time and resources.

4. **Effort validation**: The project manager must ensure that no more than the allocated number of people have been scheduled at any given time. This helps in avoiding overloading and ensures that each team member has a manageable workload.

5. **Defined responsibilities**: Every task that is scheduled should be assigned to a specific team member. This helps in ensuring that each task is completed by the right person and that there is clear accountability.

6. **Defined outcomes**: Every task that is scheduled should"
Project Scheduling.pdf,What is critical path?,5.164009,5.945644," Critical path gives you the longest duration. Delay in critical path will delay the project schedule. Path with zero slack is called critical path.  In other words, the critical path is the sequence of tasks that determines the minimum duration required to complete the project. It is the path with the least slack or float, which means that any delay in any task on this path will delay the project completion.

Screenshot 2024-03-18 094225.png,"What hall, date and time is scheduled for BE CSE G2 for the subject 19Z604?",4.768423,5.515869," HALL 4, 26.03.2024, 5.30-7.10pm. 
---------------------



The query asks for the hall, date, and time scheduled for BE CSE G2 for the subject 19Z604. To answer this query, we need to look for the row that contains the subject 19Z604 and the hall BE CSE G2.

After scanning the table, we find that the subject 19Z604 is not mentioned in the table. However, we do find the subject BE CSE G1 6, which is close to the query subject. We can assume that the query subject is likely to be the same as the subject in the table.

Looking at the row that contains the subject BE CSE G1 6, we find that it is scheduled for HALL 4 on 26.03.2024 from 5.30-7.10pm.

Therefore, the answer to the query is: HALL 4, 26.03.2024, 5.30-7.10pm."

Screenshot 2024-09-10 223242.png,Explain the routing table given in the picture,5.115972,6.192628," The routing table given in the picture is a snapshot of the routing information in the DSDV (Dynamic Source Routing) protocol. The table shows the routing information for three destinations: Nade, 170, and IY.

The columns in the table represent the following information:

* DestinationID: The ID of the destination node.
* Det: The type of movement of the destination node (e.g., ""Movement"" for a node that is moving).
* NexNode: The next node on the path to the destination node.
* Dist: The distance to the destination node.
* SccNo: The sequence number of the routing information (used for detecting and correcting routing errors).

The routing table shows that:

* To reach Nade, the next node is 15, which is 11 hops away.
* To reach 170, the next node is 186, which is 142 hops away.
* To reach IY, the next node is 214, which is 256 hops away.

The routing table is used by the DSDV protocol to determine the best path to a destination node. The protocol uses a combination of distance and sequence numbers to determine the best path. The distance is used to determine the shortest path to the destination, while the"
